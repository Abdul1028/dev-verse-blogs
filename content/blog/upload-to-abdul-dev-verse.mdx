# ✍️ How to Upload Your Blog to Abdul Dev-Verse

Do you want your technical blog to be showcased on [Abdul Dev-Verse](https://abdul-dev-verse.vercel.app/)? Good news — it’s super easy and completely open source!

This guide will walk you through the **format**, **upload process**, and how it all works behind the scenes with **GitHub Webhooks + Next.js ISR**.

---

## 🗂 Step 1: Format Your Blog Correctly

Create a new `.mdx` file and **use the following frontmatter** at the top:

```md
---
title: "Your Blog Title Here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Your Name"
summary: "One-liner that summarizes your post."
slug: "your-blog-slug"
imageUrl: "https://your-image-url"
tags:
  - "TagOne"
  - "TagTwo"
---
````

> ✅ Make sure the `slug` is also the **file name** (e.g. `slug-name.mdx`).

Here’s an example:

```md
---
title: "How to Build a Weather App in React"
date: "2025-05-18"
author: "Jane Doe"
summary: "Learn how to fetch and display real-time weather using OpenWeatherMap API and React."
slug: "weather-app-react"
imageUrl: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557682224-5b8590cd9ec5"
tags:
  - "React"
  - "API"
  - "Frontend"
---
```

Now write your blog content in MDX format below the frontmatter.

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Fork the Blog Repository

1. Visit: [https://github.com/Abdul1028/dev-verse-blogs](https://github.com/Abdul1028/dev-verse-blogs)
2. Click on **"Fork"** in the top-right corner.
3. Clone your forked repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dev-verse-blogs.git
cd dev-verse-blogs
```

---

## ✍️ Step 3: Add Your Blog File

1. Navigate to the `content/blog` directory:

   ```bash
   cd content/blog
   ```

2. Add your `.mdx` file with the same name as your `slug`:

   ```bash
   touch your-slug.mdx
   ```

3. Paste your blog content into it.

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git checkout -b add-my-blog
git add .
git commit -m "Added my blog post on [topic]"
git push origin add-my-blog
```

Then go to your forked repo on GitHub and click **"Compare & pull request"** to submit your blog for review.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Done! It’ll Be Live Automatically

Once the PR is accepted:

* A GitHub webhook triggers a rebuild.
* Next.js uses **On-Demand ISR** to fetch and render your blog.
* Your blog will appear live on: [https://abdul-dev-verse.vercel.app/](https://abdul-dev-verse.vercel.app/)

---

## 🤖 Bonus Tips

* Use markdown/MDX to embed code, images, and components.
* Use royalty-free image URLs for the `imageUrl` field (Unsplash, GitHub avatar, etc.).
* Keep your `slug` short and hyphenated.
