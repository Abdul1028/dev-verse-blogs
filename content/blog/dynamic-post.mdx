# Mastering On-Demand ISR in Next.js

Next.js revolutionized how we build fast, SEO-friendly web apps with **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**. With the introduction of **On-Demand ISR**, we now have even finer control over when pages are regenerated — enabling real-time updates **without full redeployments**.

In this post, we’ll dive into how On-Demand ISR works and how you can implement it in your Next.js app.

## 🧠 What Is ISR in Next.js?

**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** allows you to update static pages **after deployment**. With ISR, you don't need to rebuild your entire app just to reflect changes in a single page.

There are two flavors:

- **Time-based ISR**: Uses `revalidate` time in `getStaticProps`
- **On-Demand ISR**: Pages are rebuilt on command (API call)

## ⚙️ Time-Based vs On-Demand ISR

| Feature             | Time-based ISR         | On-Demand ISR              |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Trigger             | Timer (e.g., every 10s) | Manual via API call        |
| Best for            | Frequent updates        | Infrequent, important updates |
| Setup complexity    | Low                     | Medium                     |
| Flexibility         | Less                    | More                       |

## 🚀 Use Case for On-Demand ISR

Imagine you have a blog or CMS. When an admin updates a post, you want that post’s static page to be regenerated **immediately** — not after a timeout.

This is where **On-Demand ISR** shines.

## 🛠️ Setting Up On-Demand ISR in Next.js


## 🔐 Secure Your Revalidation

To prevent abuse, always use a **secret token** in your revalidation endpoint and store it in `.env`:

\`\`\`env
MY_SECRET_TOKEN=supersecret
\`\`\`

## ✅ Benefits of On-Demand ISR

- **Real-time updates** without full rebuilds
- **Better performance** with static pages
- **More control** over when updates happen
- Works well with headless CMSs like Sanity, Contentful, Strapi, etc.

## 🧪 Pro Tips

- Log the `revalidated` response for debugging
- Use webhooks in your CMS to trigger the `/revalidate` endpoint
- You can revalidate multiple pages in a single call if needed

## 📦 Bonus: Revalidate Multiple Routes

\`\`\`ts
const slugs = req.body.slugs || [];

await Promise.all(slugs.map((slug) => res.revalidate(`/blog/${slug}`)));
\`\`\`

## 🧭 Conclusion

On-Demand ISR gives you the power of static generation with the flexibility of dynamic updates. It's perfect for content-heavy apps that need to reflect updates immediately without a full rebuild.

Next.js continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible with Jamstack and serverless.
