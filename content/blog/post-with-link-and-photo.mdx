# Mastering On-Demand ISR in Next.js

Next.js revolutionized how we build fast, SEO-friendly web apps with **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**. With the introduction of **On-Demand ISR**, we now have even finer control over when pages are regenerated â€” enabling real-time updates **without full redeployments**.

In this post, weâ€™ll dive into how On-Demand ISR works and how you can implement it in your Next.js app.

## ðŸ§  What Is ISR in Next.js?

**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** allows you to update static pages **after deployment**. With ISR, you don't need to rebuild your entire app just to reflect changes in a single page.

There are two flavors:

- **Time-based ISR**: Uses `revalidate` time in `getStaticProps`
- **On-Demand ISR**: Pages are rebuilt on command (API call)
