# ðŸš€ Deploy Next.js Serverless Functions on AWS Using OpenNext

Vercelâ€™s deployment platform is fantastic â€” but what if you want to **host your Next.js app on AWS**, with full control over the infra, cost, and scaling?

Thatâ€™s where **OpenNext** comes in â€” an open-source toolkit that takes your Next.js app and builds it into a **serverless-friendly format** that can run anywhere, including AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, and Netlify.

In this guide, weâ€™ll go hands-on to deploy a Next.js app using OpenNext on **AWS Lambda**, step by step.

## ðŸ§  What is OpenNext?

**OpenNext** is an open-source project that replicates how Vercel runs Next.js in serverless environments.

It:
- Converts your `.next` build output into AWS Lambdaâ€“compatible functions
- Packages static assets for S3 + CloudFront
- Handles ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Generates an `open-next.config.mjs` for fine control

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as *Vercelâ€™s build pipeline, open-sourced*.

## ðŸ—‚ Step 1: Setup Your Next.js App

Create a new Next.js app (if you donâ€™t already have one):

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-serverless-app
cd my-serverless-app
