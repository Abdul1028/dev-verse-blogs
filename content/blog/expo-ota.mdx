# ⚡ Seamless Expo OTA Updates with GitHub Webhooks

One of Expo's most powerful features is **Over-the-Air (OTA) updates** — the ability to push updates to your users without waiting for app store reviews.

But what if you could trigger OTA deployments _automatically_ whenever you push to GitHub?

In this post, you’ll learn how to integrate **GitHub Webhooks with Expo EAS Update** to automate your OTA workflow.

---

## 🚀 What are OTA Updates in Expo?

Expo allows you to push new versions of your app JS bundle to users without publishing to the App Store or Play Store. When users open the app, they’ll download the latest version automatically.

Instead of manually running:

```bash
eas update --branch production
````

You can hook it up with GitHub to trigger this automatically.

---

## 🛠️ Setup: GitHub Webhook + EAS Update Trigger

### 1. Enable OTA Updates with EAS

Ensure you’ve configured your Expo app with EAS Update:

```bash
eas update:configure
```

> 📌 This sets up your project and links it to your Expo account.

---

### 2. Create a GitHub Action Workflow

Inside your Expo project, add the following file:

**`.github/workflows/eas-update.yml`**

```yaml
name: EAS OTA Update

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  ota-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install deps
        run: npm ci

      - name: Authenticate with Expo
        run: npx expo login -u ${{ secrets.EXPO_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.EXPO_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Publish OTA update
        run: npx eas update --branch production
```

---

### 3. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** and add:

* `EXPO_USERNAME`
* `EXPO_PASSWORD`

> 🔒 Alternatively, use an [access token](https://docs.expo.dev/accounts/programmatic-access/) and `EXPO_TOKEN`.

---

## ✅ Testing the Setup

Once configured, any push to the `main` branch will:

1. Trigger the GitHub Action.
2. Run `eas update`.
3. Push OTA updates to all users on the `production` branch.

You can also test it locally with:

```bash
eas update --branch production
```

> 🔁 Your users will get the update the next time they open the app, depending on your update policy.

---

## 🎯 Bonus: Use Channels and Branches

Want different updates for staging and production?

* Use **channels** in Expo (`staging`, `production`, etc.).
* Define branches accordingly in GitHub.
* Customize the workflow trigger:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [production]
```

And update this command:

```bash
npx eas update --branch production
```

---

## 🤖 Pro Tip: Use EAS Update + Slack

You can extend the workflow to notify your team in Slack after a successful deployment using [Slack GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slack-notify).
